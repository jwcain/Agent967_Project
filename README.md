# Agent 967: An Evidence Disposal Game
## Pitch
You work for the Super Secret Service. Triple-S, as it is called, is an elite and dangerous group; responsible for espionage and heroism all over the world. Their Agents are known for being glamorous, seductive, charming, smart, good-looking, respectable parents, and always on time.

Unfortunately, while you are a new Agent for Triple-S, you are not one of those agents. You have landed yourself a nice comfortable desk job. Your duty is to ensure the proper filing, organizing, and destruction of all evidence that the field Agents create during their job. It is often not as easy as you would like, Management seems to change their requirements daily and Agents often don’t think about what they classify as evidence.

## Overview
Agent#967 is a VR task-management/chaos game in which the player has to find optimal routes for disposing of ‘evidence’ into specified receptacles. The game takes place in a medium sized office, and in lieu of a desk, there is a conveyor belt that brings evidence into the room. Posted on the wall is a list of instructions on where each type of item needs to go; filed away, shredded, incinerated, dropped in acid, etc. The location of the disposal locations and the destination for each type of evidence changes each level.

Developing this project will help improve understanding of commercial level VR technology as well as the development of a VR product for consumers. Both of these are sought after skills in the game development industry, and completion of the project would be a beneficial improvement to a student’s resume looking to enter this field.
